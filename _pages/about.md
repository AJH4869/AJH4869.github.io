Hi! I’m Jiahao Ai, an undergraduate in Statistics at Peking University with a second major in Computer Science. I will join the Ph.D. program in Statistics and Data Science at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania in Fall 2025.

I have been fortunate to receive guidance from [**Prof. Zhimei Ren**](https://zhimeir.github.io),
[**Prof. Yuxin Chen**](https://yuxinchen2020.github.io),
and [**Prof. Ruixun Zhang**](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/ZhangRuixun) during my undergraduate years.Their mentorship has shaped my thinking and nurtured my passion for research.

My research interests lie at the intersection of uncertainty quantification, robust statistical inference, optimization & online learning, and reinforcement learning.
